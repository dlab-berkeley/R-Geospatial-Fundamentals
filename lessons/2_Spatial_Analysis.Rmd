# Part 1: Spatial Measurement Queries

## 1.1 What are spatial measurement queries?

Spatial measurement queries involve calculations such as distances, areas, and other geometric properties to provide insights into the spatial relationships within a dataset(s).

Ask questions like:

-   What is feature A's **length**?
    -   What is the length of the BART train line between Walnut Creek and Rockridge?
-   What is feature A's **distance** from feature B?
    -   What is the distance between Berkeley High School and Berkeley BART Station?
-   What is feature A's **area**?
    -   What is the area of Alameda County?

## 1.2 Area Measurement

Let's look at the answer to that last question: what is the area of Alameda County?

We'll start by loading back in our California counties dataset. We'll also plot the geometries to confirm that the dataset contains all California counties

```{r}
library(sf)

# Read in the counties shapefile
counties <- st_read("../data/california_counties/california_counties.shp")

plot(counties$geometry)
```

Next, we can select data pertaining only to Alameda County and save it to a new spatial dataframe.

```{r}
alameda <- counties[counties$NAME == 'Alameda',]

plot(alameda$geometry)
```

The operation we just performed is known as an "**attribute query**", which involves selecting or filtering data based on non-spatial attributes or properties within a dataset.

A spatial measurement query is similar, but more expansive in that it allow users to subset data and create new relationships based on spatial metrics and calculations (e.g. distances, areas). Let's use the `st_area()` function to calculate the area of Alameda County:

```{r}
st_area(alameda)
```

This gives the area of the county in square meters. Why? Each CRS generally has an associated set of measurement units; in this case, the CRS of the counties dataset uses square meters for area.

It's more useful to return the area of large regions in square KM (or sq miles) and we can do that with the `set_units()` function from the `units` package:

```{r}
units::set_units(st_area(alameda), km^2)
```

⚠️ **Warning**: manual unit conversions (e.g. dividing the m^2^ by 10^6^ to get km^2^) using the `sf` package don't translate well - converted values may still be reported as m2. Always use the `set_units()` function for unit conversion!

### 🥊 Challenge 1: Calculate square miles

Now you try it!

Calculate the area of Alameda County in sq miles.

-   What should you change `km^2` to?
-   Hint: you can take a look at the webpage [Measurement units in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units/vignettes/measurement_units_in_R.html) to get a sense of more units

```{r}

# YOUR CODE HERE

```

It's a good idea to check one or two measurements before you automate your workflow to make sure you are getting valid values. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California), the area of Alameda county is 821 mi^2^ (2130 km^2^).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can also use `st_area()` to add the area of all counties to the spatial dataframe:

```{r}

#create a new column that contains the area in km^2
counties$area_km2 <- units::set_units(st_area(counties), km^2)

# take a look at the added column
head(counties)
```

🔔 **Question**: Are the values returned by `st_area()` valid? Why might they differ?

Spatial measurements are greatly dependent on the coordinate reference system (CRS). They can differ greatly depending on the CRS. Let's take a look at the areas in different CRS's using a script with multiple functions.

```{r}
# Calculate area using data in UTM NAD83 zone 10 CRS (26910)
counties$area_km2_utm <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties,26910)), km^2)

# Calculate area using data in Web Mercator CRS (3857)
counties$area_km2_web <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties, 3857)), km^2)

# Take a look at a subset of the Name and area columns only
head(counties[,c("NAME", "area_km2", "area_km2_utm", "area_km2_web")])
```

Output Interpretation:

-   **NAD83 / CA Albers:** The source data's CRS, CA Albers, is optimized for accurate area measurements within California. Values in the **`area_km2`** column are highly precise, assuming accurate underlying geometry.

-   **UTM10:** This CRS is optimized for Northern California, making it less accurate as you move away from the zone's center (e.g., Southern California).

-   **Web Mercator:** While preserving shape, Web Mercator significantly distorts area. It's unsuitable for precise area calculations.

The important takeaway is that you need to use a CRS that is appropriate for your analysis/mapping needs!

When creating a spatial analysis work flow it is common to start by transforming all of your data to the same, appropriate CRS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.3 Length Measurement

We can use the `st_length()` operator in the same way as `st_area()` to calculate the length of features in a spatial dataframe. Always take note of the output units!

Let's determine how many miles of metro lines there are using Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) data

[Read in the BART lines data]{.underline}

```{r}
# Read in the BART lines data into a new variable
bart_lines <- st_read("../data/transportation/bart_lines_2019.geojson")  #note the different file type

#data source: https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/catalog/stanford-mh686mh0418

# Create a quick plot of the bart_lines geometry
plot(bart_lines$geometry)
```

🔔 **Question**: What type of geometry is the bart_lines dataset?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🥊 Challenge 2: Examine and modify length measurements

Similar to the `st_area()` function, the `st_length()` allows you to determine the length of a line geometry.

-   Create new columns called `length_mi`, and `length_km` that contain the length of the bartlines geometry in miles and kilometers respectively

-   Create new columns called `length_nad83`, `length_utm`, and `length_web` that contain the length of the bart_lines geometry in the (default) NAD83, UTM, and Web Mercator CRS

[Examine lengths using different units]{.underline}

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
bart_lines$length_mi <- ______
bart_lines$length_km <- ______
```

[Examine lengths using different CRS]{.underline}

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
bart_lines$length_nad83 <- ______
bart_lines$length_utm <- ______
bart_lines$length_mi <- ______

head(bart_lines["length_nad83", "length_utm", "length_mi"])
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.4 Distance Measurement

The `st_distance()` function can be used to find the distance between two geometries or two sets of geometries. Let's compute the distance between two schools.

[load in the data]{.underline}

```{r}

# Read in the school_sf shapefile
schools_sf <- st_read("../data/california_schools/california_schools.shp")
```

```{r}

#read more about the distance function
?st_distance

colnames(schools_sf) #identify the column name containg the name of the schools
```

[compute the distance between two points]{.underline}

```{r}

#determine the distance between Alameda and Berkeley high
st_distance(schools_sf[schools_sf$SchoolName=='Alameda High',], 
                          schools_sf[schools_sf$SchoolName=='Berkeley High',])
```

You can also use `st_distance()` to find the distance between multiple features. First, let's make sure that both dataframes are in the same CRS. We'll use UTM for this purpose (EPSG Code = 26910)

```{r}
schools_utm <- st_transform(schools_sf, 26910) # Assign the CRS based on EPSG code
bart_lines_utm <- st_transform(bart_lines, st_crs(schools_utm)) # Assign schools_utm CRS

#calculate the distance between Berkeley High and each portion of the BART line
st_distance(schools_utm[schools_utm$SchoolName=='Berkeley High',], bart_lines_utm)
```

Note the format of the output. The `st_distance()` calculates the distance (in meters) from the location of the school to each of the 6 BART lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 2: Spatial Relationship Queries

Measurement queries focus on the distance, area, and length of geometries. By contrast, [spatial relationship queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_relation) consider how two geometries (or sets of geometries) [relate to one another]{.underline} in space.

Relationship queries ask questions like:

-   Is feature A **within** feature B?
    -   *What schools are in the city of Berkeley?*
-   Does feature A **intersect** with feature B?
    -   *In which cities is Tilden Regional Park located?*
-   Does feature A **cross** feature B?
    -   *Do any BART train lines cross into Albany?*

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png){height="300px"}

These can be used to select features in one dataset based on their spatial relationship to another.

Let's take a look at a few relationship queries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.1 Spatial Intersections

Geometry A spatially intersects Geometry B if any of its parts (e.g., a point, line segment, or polygon) is equivalent to, touches, crosses, is contained by, contains, or overlaps any part of Geometry B.

This is the most general of all spatial relationships!

The `st_intersects()` function is used to determine intersections, and can be used to specify explicit relationships (e.g. touches) by setting the operation or `op=()` argument to any of the options listed in the `?st_intersects` help documentation (e.g. `st_touches`, `st_crosses`).

[view help documentation]{.underline}

```{r}

#see the various options similar to intersects. See the Usage section
?st_intersects
```

Let's examine a spatial intersection by determining which schools intersect Alameda county:

```{r}

#convert the counties dataframe into the utm10 CRS
counties_utm <- st_transform(counties, st_crs(schools_utm))
alameda_utm <- counties_utm[counties_utm$NAME == "Alameda",]
```

[use `st_intersects` to determine the intersection]{.underline}

```{r}
# Select only the schools that *intersect* Alameda county
alameda_schools_utm <- schools_utm[alameda_utm, , op = st_intersects]

# How many schools are in California?
nrow(schools_utm)

# How many schools are in Alameda County?
nrow(alameda_schools_utm)
```

The syntax we used was to

-   Select the features (i.e. rows) in the `schools_utm` dataframe

-   whose geometry **spatially intersects** the `alameda_utm` geometry

-   and keep all of the other `schools_utm` columns (because the extraction brackets have no second argument)

Let's create a quick plot to visualize what our selection returned (red) compared with the full set of schools (blue):

```{r}
# Alameda county
plot(alameda_utm$geometry)
# All schools
plot(schools_utm$geometry, col = "blue", add = TRUE)
# Alameda schools
plot(alameda_schools_utm$geometry, col = "red", add = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🥊 Challenge 3: Use `st_disjoint()`

Unlike the `st_intersects()` function, `st_disjoint()` subsets the features in A that do *not* share space with B. It selects the features that have no spatial intersection.

1.  Subset the counties data by selecting only `"Los Angeles"` in the `counties_utm10` county dataframe. Save this dataframe as `la_utm`

2.  Select all schools that do *not* share space with (e.g. NOT in) Los Angeles County. Save this dataframe as `schools_utm_not_la`

3.  Plot Los Angeles County in "blue" and non-Los Angeles County schools in `"red"`.

```{r}

la_utm <- ____

schools_utm_not_la <- ____[____, , op = ____]

plot(la_utm, border = "blue")
plot(schools_utm_not_la, col = "red", add = TRUE)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf) is an `sf` cheatsheet that lists and briefly explains common relationship functions

![](images/sf_Cheatsheet.png)

Let's expand on our analyses by combining measurement and relationship queries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.2 Combining Measurement and Relationship Queries

Measurement queries return a continuous value (e.g. area) while relationship queries evaluate to true or false, and then return the features for which the relationship is true. Let's take a look at a common analysis that combines those concepts: **proximity analysis**.

Proximity analyses ask questions like

-   What schools in Berkeley are within 1/4 mile of a BART station?

Proximity analysis helps identify nearby features---to find all features within a certain maximum distance of features in another dataset

A common workflow for this type of analysis is:

1.  Buffer around the features in the reference dataset to create buffer polygons. (`st_buffer()`)

2.  Run a spatial relationship query to find all features that intersect (or are within) the buffer polygons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's conduct a proximity analysis to think through the concept of a walkable city. One aspect of a walkable city is that services (e.g. public transportation) are accessible within a certain walk distance.

Let's consider how 'walkable' Alameda county schools are by looking at their proximity to BART lines.

```{r}

# Create a buffer around the bart lines of 800 meters (~1/2 mile)
bart_lines_utm_buffer = st_buffer(bart_lines_utm, dist = 800)
```

```{r}

#plotting the BART lines 800m buffer and all schools within Alameda
bart_alameda_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = alameda_utm) + 
  geom_sf(data = bart_lines_utm) +
  theme_minimal()

bart_alameda_plot #creating a plot as a separate variable could make it easier to add to the plot
```

```{r}

#add the 800m bart lines buffer
bart_alameda_plot <- bart_alameda_plot + 
  geom_sf(data = bart_lines_utm_buffer, fill = "pink", alpha = 0.5)

bart_alameda_plot
```

```{r}

#add the continuing education schools 
bart_alameda_plot <- bart_alameda_plot +
  geom_sf(data = alameda_schools_utm, color = "purple", size = 0.2)

bart_alameda_plot
```

Great! Looks like we're all ready to run our spatial relationship query to complete the proximity analysis. At this point (pun intended) we'll select the schools that are in within the BART line buffer polygons.

```{r}

#select the schools that intersect with the bart lines buffer
alameda_schools_utm_bart_buffer <- alameda_schools_utm[bart_lines_utm_buffer, , op = st_intersects]
```

Now let's overlay again, to see if the schools we selected make sense.

```{r}
# Highlight the schools intersect the BART line buffer in yellow
bart_alameda_plot <- bart_alameda_plot +  
  geom_sf(data = alameda_schools_utm_bart_buffer, color = "yellow", size = 0.2)

bart_alameda_plot
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Proximity Analysis: Nearest Feature

We can can use `st_distance()` and its companion function `st_nearest_feature()` to compute the distance between each feature of A and the nearest feature in B (e.g. a middle school and the nearest high school).

```{r}

#create a new dataframe that contains only the elementary schools in the district
alameda_elementary_schools_utm <- alameda_schools_utm[alameda_schools_utm$SchoolLevel == "Elementary",]

#create a new dataframe that contains only the middle schools in the district
alameda_middle_schools_utm <- alameda_schools_utm[alameda_schools_utm$SchoolLevel == "Middle",]
```

[identify the nearest feature]{.underline}

```{r}

# for each elementary school, extract the ID of the nearest middle school
nearest_elementary_middle_school = st_nearest_feature(alameda_elementary_schools_utm, alameda_middle_schools_utm)

# take a look!
nearest_elementary_middle_school
```

The output: the `st_nearest_feature` function returns the index or ID of the closest feature. These are stored in `nearest_elementary_middle_school`. We can use this index output to see the specific school

```{r}

#View what the index output of the st_nearest_features refers to
alameda_elementary_schools_utm[1,]
alameda_middle_schools_utm[34,]
```

We can view the full information of the nearest middle school using the fact that the output is an index.

```{r}

#extract the nearest middle school using indices 

#create a new column in the Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10 dataframe called Closest_Middle_School 

View(alameda_middle_schools_utm[nearest_elementary_middle_school, "SchoolName"])
```

Then we can use `st_distance()` to calculate the distance between each elementary school, and its nearest middle school. To do this, we will create a new column that stores the distance calculation:

[Determine the distance between the elementary school and the nearest middle school]{.underline}

```{r}
alameda_elementary_schools_utm$closest_middle_school <- alameda_middle_schools_utm$SchoolName[nearest_elementary_middle_school]

alameda_elementary_schools_utm$elementary_middle_dist <- 
  st_distance(alameda_elementary_schools_utm,
              alameda_middle_schools_utm[nearest_elementary_middle_school,], 
              by_element = TRUE)

# Extract just the school names and the distance between them
alameda_elementary_schools_utm[, c("SchoolName", "closest_middle_school", "elementary_middle_dist")]

# Sort by distance
alameda_elementary_schools_utm[order(alameda_elementary_schools_utm$elementary_middle_dist), 
                               c("SchoolName", "closest_middle_school", "elementary_middle_dist")]
```

Note that although we only selected the two columns, the geometry columns came along.

### 🥊 Challenge 4: BART Station Proximity

Let's see if we can create a dataset that contains only schools that are closest to the Downtown Berkeley BART station

```{r}
bart_stations <- st_read("../data/transportation/bart_stations_2019.geojson")
head(bart_stations)

# Step 1: 
bart_stations_utm <- st_transform(______)

st_crs(bart_stations_utm) == st_crs(alameda_schools_utm)

# Step 1: Determine the nearest station to each school in Alameda County
nearest_station <- st_nearest_feature(______, ______)

# Step 2: Find names of closest station to each school
alameda_schools_utm$closest_station <- ______$______[______]

# Step 3: Filter to only include schools near Downtown Berkeley
downtown_berkeley_schools <- ______[______$______ == "Downtown Berkeley",]
```

# Part 3: Spatial Joins And Aggregations

## 3.1 Spatial Joins

Now that we understand the logic of spatial queries, let's take a look at another fundamental spatial operation that relies on them.

This operation, called a **spatial join**, is the process by which we can leverage the spatial relationships between distinct datasets to merge their information into a new output dataset.

This operation can be thought as the spatial equivalent of an **attribute join**, in which multiple tabular datasets can be merged by aligning matching values in a common column that they both contain. Thus, we'll start by developing an understanding of this operation first!

For this, we'll pull in two new datasets: a shapefile of California census tracts, and a CSV table of median household income for census tracts in Alameda County.

```{r}
# Load California census tract shapefile
ca_tracts <- st_read("california_tracts.shp")
class(ca_tracts)
head(ca_tracts)

# Load Alameda County household income table
alameda_income <- read.csv("alameda_tract_income.csv")
class(alameda_income)
head(alameda_income)
```

Let's try out two different types of attribute joins:

-   **left_join(x, y):** Retain everything from x and only matching records from y

-   **inner_join(x, y):** Retain only records available in both x and y

We can join together our datasets using each of these join methods. This requires that both datasets share a common field - luckily, they both contain the field `GEOID`!

```{r}
# Left Join
alameda_tracts_left <- left_join(ca_tracts, alameda_income, by = "GEOID")
nrow(alameda_tracts_left)

# Inner Join
alameda_tracts_inner <- inner_join(ca_tracts, alameda_income, by = "GEOID")
nrow(alameda_tracts_inner)
```

Using the left join keeps all census tracts in California, even though we only have income data for Alameda County. Using the inner join keeps only census tracts that have a matching record in the Alameda County income dataset.

Let's convert our joined Alameda census tracts dataframe into the same CRS as our other dataframes.

```{r}
alameda_tracts_utm <- st_transform(alameda_tracts_inner, st_crs(alameda_schools_utm))
```

Next, let's plot our Alameda census tracts along with our dataframe of Alameda schools:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = alameda_tracts_utm, aes(fill = med_hhinc)) + 
  geom_sf(data = alameda_schools_utm) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see that some schools are located in high-income neighborhoods and others are located in low-income neighborhoods. But what if we want to figure out the neighborhood income associated with a particular school? This is where **spatial joins** come in.

While an attribute join allows us to join two dataframes by using a common attribute, a spatial join allows us to join two dataframes that intersect in **space**. We can perform a spatial join using the function `st_join()`:

```{r}
alameda_schools_utm <- st_join(alameda_schools_utm, alameda_tracts_utm, join = st_intersects)
```

💡 **Tip**: By default, the `st_join()` function joins by intersection. However, there are many other types of spatial joins, including joining to nearest features. See the documentation at `?st_join` for more information.

Now let's map the Alameda schools, but this time change the color based on the median household income of their neighborhood.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = alameda_tracts_utm) + 
  geom_sf(data = alameda_schools_utm, aes(color = med_hhinc)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

If we compare this map with the previous map of neighborhood incomes, we can see that the information has been transferred from the census tracts to the individual schools.

This type of spatial join can be quite useful if we want to examine the relationship between individual school characteristics and neighborhood characteristics. For example, the State of California evaluates school performance on subjects like Math on a score from 1-5. Are schools in higher-income neighborhoods more likely to get higher Math scores?

```{r}
ggplot(alameda_schools_utm) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = factor(MathScore), y = med_hhinc)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This graph suggests that schools with a Math score of 5 tend to be located in neighborhoods with substantially higher median incomes. There are many more analyses of this sort that can be accomplished with spatial joins!

## 3.2 Aggregation

We just walked through how to attach neighborhood information to specific schools via spatial joins. But what if we wanted to go the other way? What if we wanted to figure out the average school math score in each census tract?

For this, we can use the function `aggregate.sf`. This function summarizes a variable of our choice (such as `Enrollment`) within a particular geography. In this case, we can calculate the total enrollment by census tract:

```{r}
alameda_tracts_math <- sf:::aggregate.sf(x = alameda_schools_utm['Enrollment'], 
                                         by = alameda_tracts_utm, 
                                         FUN = sum)
```

We can then map the total enrollment by census tract! Neighborhoods that have multiple schools have the enrollment of each school added together. Neighborhoods without any schools are given a value of `NA`.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = alameda_tracts_math, aes(fill = Enrollment)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Key Points

-   Measurement queries involve calculating areas (`st_area() )`,and other geometric properties (`st_length() )` within spatial datasets. We looked at this, for instance, through using **`st_distance()`** to find distances between schools and transportation lines.
-   Relationship queries allow you to analyze how sets of geometries relate to each other in space. We used `st_intersect()` and `st_disjoint()` to look at schools within or outside a county.
-   Proximity analysis allows us to find nearby features (`st_nearest_feature()`) within a certain distance, like identifying schools within a certain distance of transportation lines using buffers (`st_buffer()`)
-   Spatial joins (`st_join()`) and aggregation (`aggregate.sf()`) enable us to combine together attributes from multiple spatial dataframes based solely on their spatial relationships to one another
